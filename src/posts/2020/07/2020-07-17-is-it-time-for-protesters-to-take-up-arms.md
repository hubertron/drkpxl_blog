When is it time for protesters to defend themselves from kidnapping with guns and other legal weapons?
<!-- excerpt -->

The 2nd amendment reads as follows:

>  “A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.”

Based on the videos coming out of Portland where Trump's DHS goons are unconstitutionally kidnapping people I would say it may be time to.

Also on Twitter [here](https://twitter.com/i/status/1284117114547298304).

When this happens, when your life is threatened by an unknown force it may be time to up your defenses. These protesters have a right to bear arms, and perhaps if videos like the above are the norm they should start. 

What would happen if these 2 were shot by the protester? What identities would be revealed? Are they DHS goons, Trumpers, private citizens? Who is doing this kidnapping? Would a jury accept that the the protester was asking in self-defense? 

Trump is gambling huge that something like this wouldn't happen. That the protesters are weak and won't stand up for themselves. However, given the rise of tension I really wouldn't be surprised if this private military gets shot at. Which would escalate quickly too many dead. This would be horrible for our country for so many reasons.

The media is starting to notice at least:

> The news from Portland is terrifying.
> 
> According to Oregon media and viral eyewitness videos, silent, unidentified armed men in unmarked cars are grabbing law-abiding citizens off the streets without explanation. Local authorities don&#39;t know who they are.
> 
> This is how it starts.

Hopefully the increased awareness will prevent this from escalating further.
